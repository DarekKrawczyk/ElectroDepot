**ElectroDepot** is a inventory management application for electronic components. It helps to keep track of integrated circuits (ICs) and other parts, solving the common problem of losing track of components or making unnecessary purchases. The application leverages a client-server architecture to maintain a digital inventory. Users can update their inventory when new parts are ordered or delivered.

<h2 id="custom-purpose">üéØ Purpose</h2>
ElectroDepot was created to solve the problem of disorganized component storage. As an embedded systems enthusiast, I often struggled to keep track of which components I used in certain projects or determine whether I already had parts in storage before purchasing duplicates. Many users face similar challenges. Often, components get forgotten in boxes or drawers, making it difficult to plan projects due to uncertainty about component availability.

ElectroDepot addresses these issues by:
- Maintaining a clear digital record of components.
- Organizing purchased components into categorized purchases.
- Tracking component usage across projects.

It is important to note that the application itself was a result of the learning process for the AvaloniaUI framework. I am aware of the bugs present in the code, and some parts may not follow best coding practices. However, considering that one of the main goals of writing this app was to learn a new framework, these inconveniences can be overlooked.

<h2 id="custom-architecture-and-technologies-information"> üåê Architecture and Technologies Information </h2>
The choice of technologies for ElectroDepot was driven by my desire to develop skills in areas that interest me. I selected C# and ASP.NET Core for the server-side development, as I aim to deepen my expertise in modern backend technologies. Entity Framework and MS SQL were natural choices to complement this stack.
On the client side, I opted for AvaloniaUI, as I wanted to learn a cross-platform UI framework that allows building desktop applications with a modern approach.
Additionally, I used Docker for containerization, as I wanted to gain hands-on experience with concepts related to containerized deployments and infrastructure management. This allowed me to explore best practices in software deployment while improving my overall understanding of DevOps workflows.
For testing, I chose XUnit to ensure code reliability and maintainability.

<h2 id="custom-instalation-guide"> üõ†Ô∏è Installation guide</h2>

### Client Desktop

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install ElectroDepot
- Run the `ElectroDepot.msi` setup file on your machine.
- If you're using **Linux** or **macOS**, install the appropriate version from the published installation files.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Application Requirements
- **ElectroDepot is a self-contained application**‚Äîno additional dependencies or external applications are required.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Troubleshooting Server Connection Issues
If you experience issues logging into the server, it may indicate an **invalid server configuration**. Follow these steps to resolve it:

1. Close **ElectroDepot**.
2. Navigate to `%appdata%` on your **Windows** machine.
3. Locate and open the following file:
```
AppData\Roaming\ElectroDepot\server.json
```
4. The file should look like this:
```json
{
  "IP": "localhost",
  "Port": "8081"
}
```
